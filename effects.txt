This is for the items. (read evolution.txt first!!)

So for this go to data.items.stats in HMA, at the very bottom of a item in the scroll bar there should be something that says
data.items.effects and this is where you put the effects (read this to understand). Make sure to press new data before starting to type the effects. 


Effects means data that makes a evolution item an item that can evolve your pokemon (it can also be related to pokeballs but that's not what we're talking about).

Anyways let's start, so I'm gonna make this easy for you

Here are the newly added items that don't need effects.

DUBIOUSDISC
ELECTIRIZER
MAGMARIZER
PRISM SCALE
PROTECTOR
REAPER CLOTH
SACHET 
WHIPPED-D


Now the others
will kind of act like an evolution stone (Because some are but others are supposed to be used in bag)

Anyways for the one that need effects go to LEAF STONE and go to the bottom of the scroll bar you'll see
data.items.effects copy the numbers next to the word "data" it should look like this <000000>
then copy leaf stone's numbers and go to ICE STONE and then go to the bottom of the scroll and then paste
the numbers next to data then press repoint and then you're good keep on doing that with the others copy leaf stone numbers next to the data
go to the items (that's NOT the items above) and then paste the numbers (hex i guess you can call it) and then press "repoint this one." and then you're done
Then press CTRL+S and woohoo. you have new evolution stones!!!
