Hey this is entries tutorial. 

So first make sure you expanded the dex and edited the toml for the rom and change the data.pokemon.names amount from 412 to 1266

Anyways once that's done, open HMA and then go to pokedex.stats. then scroll to unknown~115. Then make sure you selected everything in that row and select 
unknown~115 to unknown~614. Then copy.

Make sure you have notepad++ (you can use notepad i guess) and paste what you copied. Then, press ctrl+h and then in find what type 444C35 and in the replace collumn type a BLUE offset entry. 

Now press replace all and press ctrl+a and copy. Then go back to HMA and unknown 115 and then press ctrl+v. Once that's done you'll press save and then go to unknown 15 and press control v. 
This should make everyone's entries bulbasuars. Now make sure you saved and then press repoint then repoint all in unknown~15 by the bulbasaur entries and then go to this link https://pastebin.com/raw/uwjMMbtz press ctrl+a then ctrl+c and then
go back to hma unknown~15 and then ctrl+v there should be a green bar and once that's done. You'll have entries!! And finally save. And woohoo!
